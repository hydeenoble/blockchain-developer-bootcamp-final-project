A decentralized application to manage health records.

## Problem Statement
A friend recently relocated to a new country and had to start over some health procedures because his new doctor in the new country doesn't have access to the test, results and medications he has  taken over the past few years, he had to do series of test for the doctor to draw her own conslusions. 

As if going through all the medical test again were not enough, he wasn't able to vividly remeber all the initial symptons of the illness because it has be a while. 

This is the reliality of some doctors, nurses & health professionals today. They are limited in the level of (immediate) care they can provide because of the the inability to view the  complete, accurate health records of a patient. 

## Proposed solution
With the help of a decentralized application base on the etheruem network, patient records can be securely available on the blockchain and only authorized person can access it anywhere in the world.
